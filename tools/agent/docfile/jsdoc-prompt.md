Our team is working on an important Node.js library written in JavaScript and has created the following guidelines for writing JSDoc comments in our project:

<jsdoc_guidelines>
{{guidelines}}
</jsdoc_guidelines>

You have been sent this JavaScript source file:

<javascript_source_file>
{{source_file}}
</javascript_source_file>

Review our code JSDoc guidelines to make sure you understand them. Then review the given JavaScript source file and think carefully about improving the JSSoc comments for better code documentation. Are there features which are not documented but should be? Are there existing doc blocks which do not ahere to our guidelines and should be replaced or removed? With your extensive experience and our team guidelines, determine where the source code can be improved with good JSDoc comments for future reference.

There are some conventions our team follows which you should take into consideration:

- __Do not use @author tags__. We do not use the @author tag because we have many, many authors on this project.
- __Do not use @since tags__. We don't use @since version tags because it is so difficult to keep them updated.
- __Do add @typedef tags__ for type definitions when needed.

Sometimes we use `Object.defineProperties()` in class constructors to make object properties immutable after construction. This prevents accidental mutation. Documenting these constructors can be tricky, but our approach for doing it is to pull the properties out to define them at the class level while keeping the constructor intact. Here is an example of that approach:

```javascript
/**
 * Represents a scheduled job with immutable properties
 */
class Job {
    /**
     * Unique job identifier
     * @readonly
     * @type {string}
     */
    id;

    /**
     * When the job should execute
     * @readonly
     * @type {Date}
     */
    executionDate;

    /**
     * Method to execute
     * @readonly
     * @type {string}
     */
    methodName;

    /**
     * Parameters for the method
     * @readonly
     * @type {*}
     */
    params;

    /**
     * Creates a new Job instance with immutable properties
     * @param {Object} spec - Job specification object
     * @param {string} spec.id - Unique job identifier
     * @param {Date} spec.executionDate - When the job should execute
     * @param {string} spec.methodName - Method to execute
     * @param {*} spec.params - Parameters for the method
     */
    constructor(spec) {
        // Use defineProperties to make these fields immutable after construction
        // This prevents accidental modification of core job identity
        Object.defineProperties(this, {
            id: {
                enumerable: true,
                value: spec.id,
            },
            executionDate: {
                enumerable: true,
                value: spec.executionDate,
            },
            methodName: {
                enumerable: true,
                value: spec.methodName,
            },
            params: {
                enumerable: true,
                value: spec.params,
            },
        });
    }
}
```

Lastly, after making your changes to the JavaScript source file be sure to save it using the save_source_file tool so your team can review it.
