Ok, that looks great!

Let's implement your plan by writing tests in a single JavaScript source file. But, before you do, you'll need to know more about the test framework and assertions library we use.

First, learn more about our assertion library from the documentation:

<assertion_library>
{{assertions}}
</assertion_library>

Next, review the documentation about our test framework called Kixx Test and our stub and spy framework called Sinon:

<test_framework>
{{test_framework}}
</test_framework>

Now that you have a full understanding of how to write tests in our project, you can get started. Think carefully and don't forget to follow your plan and stick to the Kixx Test framework, Sinon and Kixx Assert library we've provided for you. And keep in mind that you may not need to spy or stub function and methods with Sinon in every test.

After creating the new test file be sure to save it using the save_test_file tool so your team can review it.
