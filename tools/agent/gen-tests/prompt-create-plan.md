Our team is working on an important Node.js library written in JavaScript and has created the following guidelines for creating unit tests in our project:

<test_guidelines>
{{guidelines}}
</test_guidelines>

You have been sent this JavaScript source file:

<JavaScript_file>
{{source_file}}
</JavaScript_file>

Review our unit test authoring guidelines above to make sure you understand them. Then review the given JavaScript source file and think carefully about how to test the component it defines, following the tenets, principles and best practices in our test guidelines. As you are thinking through this component and how to test it create a test plan for the component. The plan should not make any assumptions about what test framework or assertion library we will use and should not include any source code examples yet.

Do not implement any tests yet. Let's get a plan in place first.
