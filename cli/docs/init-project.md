The `init-project` command will create or update all your
conventional project files and directories.

Before running `init-project`, ensure that you've created a project directory
and placed a package.json file in it, or run `npm init` to create a
package.json file in it.

Then, the `init-project` command will assume your current working directory is
your project directory, so ensure you are in your project directory
before running it.

Options
-------

--name (-n) *optional*
    The name for your application. If not provided, the name in the package.json will be used.
