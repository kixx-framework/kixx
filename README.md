Kixx Hypermedia Framework
=========================
Kixx is a web development framework for Node.js servers which is derived from these core principles:

### 1. Optimize for productivity.

### 2. Computer programming is an art and a craft.

### 3. Remove complexity from the framework *and* the applications which are built on it.

### 4. The World Wide Web is our application development and distribution platform of choice.

### 5. Embrace the essence of the Web and optimize for building [Hypermedia Driven Applications](https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-driven-applications/).

### 6. Have a bias toward monilithic applications over distributed or microservice architectures.

### 7. Have opinions and make decisions.

## Environment Support

| Env     | Version    |
|---------|------------|
| ECMA    | >= ES2022  |
| Node.js | >= 16.13.2 |
| Deno    | >= 1.0.0   |

This library is designed for use in an ES6 module environment requiring __Node.js >= 16.13.2__. It targets at least [ES2022](https://node.green/#ES2022).

If you're curious: Node.js >= 16.13.2 is required for [ES6 module stabilization](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules) and [ES2022 support](https://node.green/#ES2020).

__Note:__ There is no TypeScript here. There are reasons for that: Primarily developer happiness.
