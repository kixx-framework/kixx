Kixx.js
=======
Kixx.js is a web development framework derived from these core principles:

__1. The technologies which make up the World Wide Web constitute our application development and distribution platform of choice.__

__2. An application development framework must remove complexity, both from within the framework and from the applications which are built on it.__

__3. Computer programming is art form. It is an expression of human creativity and imagination on the medium of computers.__
