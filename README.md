Kixx
====
__A rapid web development framework for humans and their AI tools.__

Build blazing fast in AI environments like Claude Code and Cursor without generating piles of shit code youâ€™ll need to rewrite later.

Created by [Kris Walker](https://www.kriswalker.me) 2017 - 2025.

Concepts
--------
### Improved AI Control
Use AI for what it's good at and otherwise get it out of way.

Kixx manages the LLM context from an MCP server, guiding the LLM to use convention and configuration over code to keep AI agents out of trouble.

Your AI environment has the information and tools it needs to be helpful, but not so much context to waste time thrashing around.

### Developer Power
Kixx never takes away your power to shoot yourself in the foot.

You'll always have full control over your projects with the ability to extend everything with your own code while directing your AI tools in the background.

All conventions and configurations can be overridden, new code can be added, and existing code can be extended.

Core Principles
---------------

### 1. Optimize for productivity.

### 2. Software is a craft.

### 3. Remove complexity from the framework *and* the applications which are built on it.

### 4. The World Wide Web is the best application platform ever invented.

### 5. AI tools can be used without negative moral, ethical, or environmental impacts.

### 6. Bias in favor of monolithic applications over distributed or microservice architectures.

### 7. Have opinions.

Environment
-----------
Kixx works with Node.js and supports these versions of JavaScript (ECMA) and Node.js:

| Env     | Version    |
|---------|------------|
| ECMA    | >= ES2022  |
| Node.js | >= 16.13.2 |

__Note:__ There is no TypeScript here. There are reasons for that - primarily developer happiness ;-)

Hypermedia-Driven Applications
------------------------------
Hypermedia-Driven Applications are web application where **hypermedia (HTML) serves as the engine of application state**. Instead of relying on JavaScript to manage state and coordinate between client and server, the application state changes by following links and submitting forms embedded in the HTML responses.

1. **Server-side rendering** of all application state
2. **State transitions through hypermedia** (links and forms)
3. **Progressive enhancement** with minimal JavaScript
4. **RESTful architecture** with HTML hypertext as the representation of state
5. **Monolithic design** for simplicity and productivity

The Kixx framework embodies these principles, providing a productive environment for building web apps that are simple, fast, and maintainable.
