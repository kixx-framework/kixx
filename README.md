Kixx.js
=======
Kixx is a web development framework for Node.js servers which is derived from these core principles:

__1. The technologies which make up the World Wide Web constitute our application development and distribution platform of choice.__

__2. An application development framework must remove complexity, both from within the framework and from the applications which are built on it.__

__3. Computer programming is art form. It is an expression of human creativity and imagination on the medium of computers.__

## Environment Support

| Env     | Version    |
|---------|------------|
| ECMA    | >= ES2022  |
| Node.js | >= 16.13.2 |
| Deno    | >= 1.0.0   |

This library is designed for use in an ES6 module environment requiring __Node.js >= 16.13.2__. It targets at least [ES2022](https://node.green/#ES2022).

If you're curious: Node.js >= 16.13.2 is required for [ES6 module stabilization](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules) and [ES2022 support](https://node.green/#ES2020).

__Note:__ There is no TypeScript here. There are reasons for that: Primarily developer happiness.
