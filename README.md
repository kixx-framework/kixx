kixx.js
=======
Kixx.js is a web development framework. It is created from these core principles:

1. The set of technologies which make up the World Wide Web constitute our open applicatio development and distribution platform of choice.
2. The single biggest responsibility of an application development framework is to remove complexity, both from within the framework and from the applications which are built on it.
3. Computer programming is a form of art. It is an expression of human creativity and imagination on the medium of software.
